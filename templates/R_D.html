        <h6 class="text-center">The software package found here consists of a track simulation and error detector. The simulator creates broadacre passes over a selected area, with positioning errors included. The error detector will then assess the simulated paths for position biases or jumps, and document accordingly.

Creating error detection software is vital to increase the effectiveness of lower absolute precision hardware and software for broadacre agriculture. Knowing when across track jumps, drift or pass variation occurs is required to be able to correctly identify improvements and negate potential overlap or underlap. 

Simulating errors to evaluate the error detection softwares is important to test our solution quality. The combination of error detection and track simulation is a practical and feasible way for detection of  positioning errors and quantifying relative accuracy parameters.
